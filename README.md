cl-plot
=======

A plotting library in Common Lisp, based on [Cairo](http://cairographics.org) and [cl-cairo2](http://github.com/rpav/cl-cairo2).

## What is it?

Somehow, Lisp lacks a good plotting solution. Most Lisp plotting packages are either interfaces to to gnuplot or bindings to C libraries such as pl-plot. What's missing is a Lisp-y plotting interface that does for CL what Matplotlib does for Python. All the pieces that make up a plot (figure, axes, data, etc.) should be CLOS objects that the user can manipulate if they wish. The only outside dependency is cl-cairo2 (and Cairo itself, obviously). Cairo is great for producing vector graphics and cl-cairo2 is very stable.

## Features

Currently the following components of a scene have been implemented:
- figures
- axes
